  Abstract                 = {Abstract Embedding tidal turbines within simulations of realistic large-scale tidal flows is a highly multi-scale problem that poses significant computational challenges. Here this problem is tackled using actuator disc momentum (ADM) theory and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) with, for the first time, dynamically adaptive mesh optimisation techniques. Both k − ω and k − ω \{SST\} \{RANS\} models have been developed within the Fluidity framework, an adaptive mesh \{CFD\} solver, and the model is validated against two sets of experimental flume test results. A brief comparison against a similar OpenFOAM model is presented to portray the benefits of the finite element discretisation scheme employed in the Fluidity \{ADM\} model. This model has been developed with the aim that it will be seamlessly combined with larger numerical models simulating tidal flows in realistic domains. This is where the mesh optimisation capability is a major advantage as it enables the mesh to be refined dynamically in time and only in the locations required, thus making optimal use of limited computational resources. },

  Abstract                 = {Research into the use of unstructured mesh methods in oceanography has been growing steadily over the past decade. The advantages of this approach for domain representation and non-uniform resolution are clear. However, a number of issues remain, in particular those related to the computational cost of models produced using unstructured mesh methods compared with their structured mesh counterparts. Mesh adaptivity represents an important means to improve the competitiveness of unstructured mesh models, where high resolution is only used when and where necessary. In this paper, an optimization-based approach to mesh adaptivity is described where emphasis is placed on capturing anisotropic solution characteristics. Comparisons are made between the results obtained with uniform isotropic resolution, isotropic adaptive resolution and fully anisotropic adaptive resolution.},
