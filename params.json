{"name":"Fluidity on GitHub","tagline":"Fluidity GitHub Pages","body":"### Welcome to Fluidity on GitHub\r\n\r\nFluidity is an open source, general purpose, multi-phase computational fluid dynamics code capable of numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equation and accompanying field equations on arbitrary unstructured finite element meshes in one, two and three dimensions. It is used in a number of different scientific areas including geophysical fluid dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, ocean modelling and mantle convection. It uses a finite element/control volume method which allows arbitrary movement of the mesh with time dependent problems, allowing mesh resolution to increase or decrease locally according to the current simulated state. It has a wide range of element choices including mixed formulations.\r\n\r\nFluidity can be installed on Ubuntu from binary packages in the fluidity-core PPA ( https://launchpad.net/~fluidity-core/+archive/ppa ) with:\r\n\r\n sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fluidity-core/ppa\r\n\r\n sudo apt-get update\r\n\r\n sudo apt-get -y install fluidity\r\n\r\n[FAQs | https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity/wiki/FAQs ] for Fluidity","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
