            <h2>What is Fluidity?</h2>
            <p>Fluidity is an open source, general purpose, multiphase computational fluid dynamics code capable of numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equation and accompanying field equations on arbitrary unstructured finite element meshes in one, two and three dimensions. It is parallelised using MPI and is capable of scaling to many thousands of processors. Other innovative and novel features are a user-friendly GUI and a Python interface which can be used to calculate diagnostic fields, set prescribed fields or set user-defined boundary conditions.</p>

		   <h2>Application areas</h2>
		   <p>Fluidity is used in a number of different scientific areas including geophysical fluid dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, ocean modelling and mantle convection. It uses a finite element/control volume method which allows arbitrary movement of the mesh with time dependent problems, allowing mesh resolution to increase or decrease locally according to the current simulated state. It has a wide range of element choices including mixed formulations. See below for more detailed examples.</p>
