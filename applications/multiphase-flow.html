    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="container">
        <p>Multiphase flows comprise two or more phases of matter (solid, liquid, gas, etc) that are simultaneously present and are allowed to inter-penetrate <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/computational-science/computational-methods-multiphase-flow">(Prosperetti and Tryggvason, 2007)</a>. Furthermore, each phase is classed as either <i>continuous</i> or <i>dispersed</i>, where a continuous phase is a connected liquid or gas substance in which dispersed phases (comprising a finite number of solid particles, liquid droplets and/or gas bubbles) may be immersed <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Multiphase-Flows-with-Droplets-and-Particles-Second-Edition/Crowe-Schwarzkopf-Sommerfeld-Tsuji/9781439840504">(Crowe et al., 1998)</a>. Some examples include the transportation of solid sediment particles in a river, the flow of blood cells around the human body, and the explosive eruptions of hot ash and gas from a volcano.</p>

        <p>Fluidity features two multiphase flow models; one for incompressible flow and another for compressible flow. Details of their implementation can be found in the thesis by <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/12785">Jacobs (2013)</a>. To enable the mixing and inter-penetration of phases, a separate velocity field (and hence a separate momentum equation) is assigned to each one and solved for. Extra terms are then included to account for inter-phase interactions. Furthermore, the models currently assume no mass transfer between phases, and a common pressure field so that only one continuity equation is used.</p>

    <!-- Volcanic ash settling in water -->

        <h2>Volcanic ash settling in water</h2>
        <p>In this example, Fluidity's incompressible multiphase flow model is used to replicate a laboratory experiment of tephra (fine volcanic ash particles) settling through a tank of water (Carey, 1997). The experiments by Carey (1997) introduced tephra particles into a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.7 m tank, filled with water, from above using a delivery system and a particle disperser. The particles settled through the air in the tank at an approximately constant rate until they landed in the water and began to settle through the water at a much reduced velocity. While the particles in the water were sufficiently dispersed their settling velocity was that predicted by Stokes' flow (a few mm/s).  However, the build-up of particles caused by the air-water interface eventually created a layer of particles and water with a bulk density so great, relative to the density of the particle-poor water beneath, as to be gravitationally unstable and promote the formation of a vertical gravity current (plumes). The settling velocity of these plumes of particles and water was observed to be an order of magnitude greater than the Stokes settling velocity of the individual particles.</p>

        <p>Rather than represent each tephra particle individually using a multimaterial model (which would be prohibitively expensive), the multiphase model is adopted in which one phase represents the water in the tank and the other phase represents all the particles dispersed within the water. A volume fraction field is used to distinguish between the continuous phase (water) and the dispersed phase (particles). In an element the volume fraction of particles represents the fraction of the element volume that is occupied by particles, which is typically very small. In contrast to the multimaterial approach, however, the multiphase approach assigns each phase a separate velocity, allowing the dispersed phase (particles) to move through the continuous phase (water). In this example, the dispersed phase is more dense than the continuous phase and so sinks under the influence of gravity.</p>
