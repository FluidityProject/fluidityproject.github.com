        <h2>Square Convection</h2>
        <p>In this example we compare the numerical predictions of Fluidity with a well-established two-dimensional cartesian geometry benchmark result for Stokes flow <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1989.tb05511.x">(Blankenbach et al., 1989)</a>. Fluidity’s results from this, and similar cases, are published in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011GC003551">Davies et al. (2011)</a>, where solution strategies employed for solving the Stokes system are also discussed.</p>
        
        <p>The specific example considered is steady-state isoviscous convection at a Rayleigh number (Ra) of 10<sup>5</sup>, in a two-dimensional square domain of unit dimensions. Boundary conditions for temperature are T = 0 at the surface, T = 1 at the base, with insulating (homogeneous Neumann) side-walls. For velocity, free-slip and no normal flow boundary conditions are specified at all boundaries.</p>

        <i>Results from 2-D, isoviscous Stokes square convection benchmark cases: (a) Nusselt number vs. number of triangle vertices, at Ra = 10<sup>5</sup> [case 1b: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1989.tb05511.x">Blankenbach et al. (1989)</a>, for a series of uniform, structured meshes. Filled circles reporesent the example cases at a resolution of 24 x 24 and 48 x 48 elements respectively. The open circle represents the result from a case at 96 × 96 elements, to illustrate that as mesh resolution is increased, solutions converge towards the benchmark values; (b) RMS velocity vs. number of triangle vertices, at Ra = 10<sup>5</sup>. Benchmark values are denoted by horizontal dashed lines. Note that the highest resolution case is not included in the example.</i>

        <p>The results presented in the figures above. The final steady-state solution consists of one convective cell, with hot upwelling flow confined to the left hand side of the domain and cold down-welling flow on the right hand side. Note that, excluding the location of upwelling flow at x = 0 or x = 1, results are insensitive to the initial condition. Quantitatively, results show excellent agreement with the benchmark predictions of Blankenbach et al. (1989), with solution accuracy improving with increased resolution, as expected. A higher resolution case (at a resolution of 96 × 96 elements), achieves results that are almost identical to the benchmark solution.</p>
