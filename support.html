    </header>
    
    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="container">
        <p>We will try to support you, should you choose to use Fluidity. Our ethos is to also educate our users, so we provide documentation and support in several ways described below.
    </div>
    
    <!-- Manual -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2>User Manual</h2>
        <p>The Fluidity manual is a comprehensive document describing the installation procedure, the equations and their numerical approximation, various parameterisations and embedded models, meshing and adaptive re-meshing and how to configure Fluidity, visualisation of Fluidity output.</p>
        
        <p>The Fluidity manuals are accesible as PDF files through Figshare. We have chosen a popular online digital repository as it allows us to obtain a Digital Object Identification (DOI) for the manual, making it citable. The manual is written using LaTeX and the code is distributed with the rest of the Fluidity code.</p>
        
        <p>The manual of the latest version Fluidity (v4.1.12) is available <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1387713">here</a>. The manuals of earlier versions can be located <a href="https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity/wiki/The-Fluidity-Manual">here</a>, as well as information on the manual source code.</p>

        <h2>Wiki</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity/wiki">Fluidity wiki</a> is an on-line resource which addresses issues that are routinely encountered during Fluidity installation and use.</p>

    <!-- Training course -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Training Course</h2>
        <p>A three day course is held once a year, covering Fluidity installation, Finite element basics, Numerical considerations, Meshing, Setting up & running simulations and Visualising results. We try to cater for audiences with a broad spectrum of experience in all aspects of computational science. The workshop is held typically during November, at Imperial College London. If there is high demand we will consider organising additional workshops at other locations. Contact <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott">Matthew Piggott</a> with any queries.</p>
        
        <p>The next course will be held 11-13 November 2015. View the schedule <a href="training/index.html">here</a></p>.
